# 🐍 SnakeGame - Java (2017)  This is a simple version of the classic Snake game, created in pure Java on **June 17th, 2017**, when I was 17 years old.   It was built without using classes or object-oriented principles — just one chaotic `.java` file, full of global variables, nested conditionals, and raw logic.
